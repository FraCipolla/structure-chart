# structure chart

this demo is just to provide a simple interface to create [structure chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_chart)

It's not a finished product so don't try to break it, you're gonna success easly ;)

if you have some improvement in mind, please create an issue explaining what to improve

## functionality
- download the chart as png
- export the chart structure as json
- import an exported chart into the current panel
- store the chart inside the local storage
- load stored charts

## Guideline
possible structure chart operations are:
- create a function node
- link nodes together
- create a while loop (the oval in the top right. Resize it to include all desired nodes)
- if statement (the green rhombus)
- declare e var. Click the arrow to switch the dot between empty and full. Click under the control buttons to insert the variable name

Additionally, you can remove any node or edge. For edges click on the one to remove and press 'canc' or 'backspace'

Enjoy!
